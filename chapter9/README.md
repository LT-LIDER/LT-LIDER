Expected study time:  hours per task

Language of instruction: English

## Activity overview

The student will fine-tune an open-source multiligual NMT (mNMT) model for low-resource language pairs (LRL), such as English-Catalan. The translation performance of the fine-tuned model should be compared against the original baseline using automatic evaluation metrics. 

We will be using the NLLB architecture for fine-tuning. Fine-tuning is a critical process where we take the model's weights, pre-trained on a vast, diverse corpus, and incrementally adjust them using our LRL parallel corpus. This procedure allows the NLLB model to better capture the unique stylistic, lexical, and grammatical information of our LRL pair, improving its translation quality.

- **Task 1**: Fine-tune multiligual NMT model
  -  TODO
  - Download the Python notebook from the notebooks directory and upload it into colab
  - Download the English-Catalan parallel data tiles (.txt) from the data directory and upload them into colab
- **Task 2**: Back-translation of tuned multiligual NMt model
  - TODO
  - Download the Python notebook from the notebooks directory and upload into colab
  - Download the English-Catalan parallel data and Catalan monolingual data files (.txt) from the data directory and upload them into colab
